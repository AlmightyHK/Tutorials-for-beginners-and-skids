Im using a OVH Game Server...You can use NFO too but OVH has stronger protection.
Centos 6 64 bit works best.

Installation

Run the script and follow the assistant:

wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.
